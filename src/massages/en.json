This is Jurakuen, a family-run tea shop approaching its centennial. The tea garden, preserved through three generations, is now embarking on a new challenge of complete pesticide-free and chemical fertilizer-free cultivation.",
            "paragraph2": "What we pursued was 'a cup that is gentle to both body and environment.' Instead of chemical fertilizers, we incorporate homemade compost, and all weeds are removed by hand—this dedication to meticulous care has given birth to 'Fuji Matcha Kagayaki.'",
            "paragraph3": "Selecting only young leaves suitable for tencha, we concentrate umami through 21 days of shade cultivation. The tea leaves, after steaming and drying, are slowly ground by stone mills at the long-established Meiko Tea Industry, transforming into matcha with vivid green color and mellow sweetness.",
            "paragraph4": "Spring, when new buds sprout in the tea fields, and the wind rustles through them. The chirping of birds, Mount Fuji in the distance—because we want you to taste the entire landscape, Jurakuen sometimes opens tea picking and stone mill grinding experiences for those who wish. Freshly ground matcha enjoyed in the quiet countryside is exceptionally fragrant."
