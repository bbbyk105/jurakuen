Brewed by a brewery with 300 years of history, it combines traditional brewing techniques with the natural blessings of Fuji. Created as a true sake made only from rice and water, it embodies our determination to challenge the world."

                "answer": "Both are the same AMACHIHOSHISORA Junmai Daiginjo, using underground water from Fuji and 100% Yamada-nishiki rice. The only difference is the volume. The 720ml is recommended for gifts or those who want to enjoy it slowly, while the 500ml is recommended for first-time purchases or small groups."

                "answer": "Yes, we also sell completely pesticide-free matcha from Shizuoka Prefecture (20g $55.00 AUD). Like our sake, we offer it as a high-quality product that values nature's blessings. You can also enjoy it in combination with our sake."
            },
            {
                "question": "Please tell me about the rice you use",
                "answer": "AMACHIHOSHISORA uses 100% Yamada-nishiki, the finest sake brewing rice. Yamada-nishiki is known for its large grains and large shinpaku (white core), making it ideal for brewing elegant sake with little off-flavor, and is an important element supporting the quality of junmai daiginjo."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is underground water from Fuji?",
                "answer": "It is clear groundwater that has been filtered through volcanic rock layers over many years after rain and snow that fell on Mount Fuji penetrated underground. It is soft water with good mineral balance, ideal for sake brewing, and forms the foundation of AMACHIHOSHISORA's taste."
            },

                "question": "How is delivery handled?",

            {
                "question": "Please tell me the recommended way to drink",
                "answer": "We recommend drinking it chilled (about 10-15°C). You can enjoy the delicate aroma and taste of junmai daiginjo to the fullest."
            },
            {
                "question": "Please tell me about storage methods",
                "answer": "Please store in a cool place away from direct sunlight. After opening, store in the refrigerator and drink as soon as possible. With proper storage, you can enjoy the original taste of AMACHIHOSHISORA for a long time."
